            <p><strong>Picture this: It's 3 AM. Developers are bleary-eyed, updating docs that still think Pluto is a planet. Customer success is fielding angry calls about "features" that don't exist anymore. Product managers are having nightmares about release notes causing mass confusion. Sound familiar?</strong></p>
            <p><strong>That's the chaotic world that inspired Edmo. We've seen it all - developers drowning in documentation debt, customer success heroes apologizing for outdated info, product managers playing an endless game of catch-up, and customers more confused than a cat in a dog show.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>We created Edmo to bring peace to this documentation warzone. To transform those late-night doc sessions into peaceful slumbers. To turn customer frustration into delight. To let product managers focus on the future, not fixing the past.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>With Edmo, we're not just updating docs - we're updating relationships. Between devs and their code. Between customer success and their sanity. Between product managers and their roadmaps. And most importantly, between your product and your customers.</strong></p>
